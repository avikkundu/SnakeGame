# SnakeGame
This is a snake game built for my school project back in 2018.
This is a replica of the standard snake game.The game ends when the snake hits the walls.The score is determined by the number of food balls eaten by the snake.
With increase in length of the snake the spped of the snake increases.

This project was made using the BLUEJ IDE.
